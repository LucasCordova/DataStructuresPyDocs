        <p>The first thing to do when studying an algorithm is to understand the <strong>data</strong>. What is the
           input? What is the output?</p>
        <p><strong>Input:</strong> Graph search algorithms, including A*, take a “graph” as input. A graph is a set of
           <em>locations</em><svg class="nodes" fill="hsl(220, 50%, 60%)" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 10 10">
              <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4"></circle>
           </svg> (“nodes”) and the <em>connections</em><svg class="edges" width="2em" height="1em"
              viewBox="0 0 30 20">
              <path class="edge" stroke="hsl(160, 30%, 50%)" stroke-width="4.5" d="M 0,10 l 30,0"></path>
           </svg> (“edges”) between them. Here’s the graph I gave to A*:</p>
        <figure id="diagram-graphs1" style="position:relative;text-align:left"><img
              alt="Different map with the same pathfinding graph"
              src="same-graph-different-map.jpg?2018-12-28-08-32-36"
              style="position:absolute;padding:4px;width:100%;z-index:1">

           <div id="diagram-graphs1-under" class="intro-diagram alternate-hide"
              style="position:absolute;width:100%;z-index:3"></div>
           <div id="diagram-graphs1-over" class="intro-diagram" style="position:relative;width:100%;z-index:4"><canvas
                 width="653" height="331"></canvas></div>
        </figure>
        <p>A* doesn’t see anything else. It only sees the graph. It doesn’t know whether something is indoors or
           outdoors, or if it’s a room or a doorway, or how big an area is. <em>It only sees the graph!</em> It doesn’t
           know the difference between this map and <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-different-map">this other
              one</button>.</p>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong> The path found by A* is <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-path-trace">made of
              graph nodes and edges</button>. The edges are abstract mathematical concepts. A* will tell you to move
           from one location to another <em>but it won’t tell you how</em>. Remember that it doesn’t know anything
           about rooms or doors; all it sees is the graph. You’ll have to decide whether a graph edge returned by A*
           means moving from tile to tile or walking in a straight line or opening a door or swimming or running along
           a curved path.</p>
        <p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> There are many different ways of turning a game map into a pathfinding graph.
           Instead of making doorways into nodes, what if we made <button class="hover"
              id="show-graphs2-waypoints">doorways into edges</button>? What if we used <button class="hover"
              id="show-graphs2-grid">a pathfinding grid</button>?</p>
        <figure style="position:relative">
           <div id="diagram-graphs2-navmesh" class="intro-diagram" style="position:relative;width:100%"><canvas
                 width="653" height="331"></canvas></div>
           <div id="diagram-graphs2-waypoints" class="intro-diagram" style="position:absolute;width:100%;top:0"><canvas
                 width="653" height="331"></canvas></div>
           <div id="diagram-graphs2-grid" style="position:absolute;width:100%;top:0"><canvas width="653"
                 height="331"></canvas></div>
        </figure>
        <p>The pathfinding graph doesn’t have to be the the same as the original problem being solved. A grid map can
           use a non-grid pathfinding graph, or vice versa. A* runs fastest with the fewest graph nodes; grids are
           often easier to work with but result in lots of nodes. This page covers the A* algorithm but not graph
           design; see <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html">my other
              page</a><sup class="print-endnote">[4]</sup> for more about graphs. For the explanations on the rest of
           the page, <em>I’m going to use grids because it’s easier to visualize the concepts</em>, but all of these
           algorithms and sample code work on non-grids too.</p>
