        <p>The first thing to do when studying an algorithm is to understand the <strong>data</strong>. What is the
           input? What is the output?</p>
        <p><strong>Input:</strong> Graph search algorithms, including A*, take a “graph” as input. A graph is a set of
           <em>locations</em><svg class="nodes" fill="hsl(220, 50%, 60%)" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 10 10">

           </svg> (“edges”) between them. Here’s the graph I gave to A*:</p>

        <p>A* doesn’t see anything else. It only sees the graph. It doesn’t know whether something is indoors or
           outdoors, or if it’s a room or a doorway, or how big an area is. <em>It only sees the graph!</em> It doesn’t
           know the difference between this map and <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-different-map">this other

        <p><strong>Output:</strong> The path found by A* is <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-path-trace">made of
              graph nodes and edges</button>. The edges are abstract mathematical concepts. A* will tell you to move
           from one location to another <em>but it won’t tell you how</em>. Remember that it doesn’t know anything
           about rooms or doors; all it sees is the graph. You’ll have to decide whether a graph edge returned by A*
           means moving from tile to tile or walking in a straight line or opening a door or swimming or running along
           a curved path.</p>
        <p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> There are many different ways of turning a game map into a pathfinding graph.
           Instead of making doorways into nodes, what if we made <button class="hover"
              id="show-graphs2-waypoints">doorways into edges</button>? What if we used <button class="hover"
              id="show-graphs2-grid">a pathfinding grid</button>?</p>
        <figure style="position:relative">

        <p>The pathfinding graph doesn’t have to be the the same as the original problem being solved. A grid map can
           use a non-grid pathfinding graph, or vice versa. A* runs fastest with the fewest graph nodes; grids are
           often easier to work with but result in lots of nodes. For the explanations on the rest of
           the page, <em>I’m going to use grids because it’s easier to visualize the concepts</em>, but all of these
           algorithms and sample code work on non-grids too.</p>

              class="anchor" href="#breadth-first-search">#</a></h2>
        <p>The key idea for all of these algorithms is that we keep track of an expanding ring called the <em
              class="frontier">frontier</em>. On a grid, this process is sometimes called “flood fill”, but the same
           technique also works for non-grids. <strong>Start the animation</strong> to see how the frontier expands

        <figure id="diagram-frontier"><canvas width="654" height="331"></canvas></figure>
        <p>How do we implement this? Repeat these steps until the <span class="frontier">frontier</span> is empty:</p>

           <li>Pick and remove <span class="current">a location</span> from the <span

                 class="square neighbors-bg"> </span>→<span class="square frontier-bg"> </span>  .</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let’s see this up close. The tile are numbered in the order we visit them. <strong>Step through to see the
              expansion process:</strong></p>
        <figure id="diagram-expansion"><canvas width="654" height="295"></canvas></figure>
        <p>It’s only ten lines of (Python) code:</p>
        <pre>frontier = Queue()
frontier.put(start <svg class="icon" alt="(blob icon)" viewBox="-1050 -1200 2100 2100" xml:base="../_icon-blob.svg"><use xlink:href="#blob-icon"></use></svg>)
reached = set()
reached.add(start)

while not frontier.empty():
  current = frontier.get()
  for next in graph.neighbors(current):
     if next not in reached:
        frontier.put(next)
        reached.add(next)</pre>
        <p>This loop is the essence of the graph search algorithms on this page, including A*. But how do we find the
           shortest path? The loop doesn’t actually construct the paths; it only tells us how to visit everything on
           the map. That’s because Breadth First Search can be used for a lot more than just finding paths. Let’s modify the loop to keep track of <em>where we came from</em> for every location
           that’s been reached, and rename the <code class="reached">reached</code> set to a <code
              class="came_from">came_from</code> table (the keys of the table are the reached set):</p>
        <pre>frontier = Queue()
frontier.put(start <svg class="icon" alt="(blob icon)" viewBox="-1050 -1200 2100 2100" xml:base="../_icon-blob.svg"><use xlink:href="#blob-icon"></use></svg>)
<em>came_from</em> = dict() # path A-&gt;B is stored as came_from[B] == A
<em>came_from</em>[start] = <em>None</em>

while not frontier.empty():
  current = frontier.get()
  for next in graph.neighbors(current):
     if next not in <em>came_from</em>:
        frontier.put(next)
        <em>came_from</em>[next] = <em>current</em></pre>
        <p>Now <code class="came_from">came_from</code> for each location points to the place where we came from. They
           form a “flow field” and act like “breadcrumbs”. They’re enough to reconstruct the entire path. Move the
           cross <svg class="icon" alt="(X icon)" viewBox="-10 -10 20 20" xml:base="../_icon-cross.svg">
              <path d="M -9,-9 L 9,9 M -9,9 L 9,-9" stroke="hsl(310, 50%, 50%)" stroke-width="6.75"></path>
           </svg> to see how following the arrows gives you a reverse path back to the start position.</p>
        <figure id="diagram-path-reconstruction"><canvas width="654" height="331"></canvas></figure>
        <p>To reconstruct paths: <em>follow the arrows backwards <b>from</b> the goal <b>to</b> the start</em>. A path
           is a <em>sequence of edges</em>, but often it’s easier to store the nodes:</p>
        <pre>current = goal <svg class="icon" alt="(X icon)" viewBox="-10 -10 20 20" xml:base="../_icon-cross.svg"><path d="M -9,-9 L 9,9 M -9,9 L 9,-9" stroke="hsl(310, 50%, 50%)" stroke-width="6.75"></path></svg>
path = []
while current != start: <svg class="icon" alt="(blob icon)" viewBox="-1050 -1200 2100 2100" xml:base="../_icon-blob.svg"><use xlink:href="#blob-icon"></use></svg>
  path.append(current)
  current = came_from[current]
path.append(start) # optional
path.reverse() # optional</pre>
        <p>That’s the simplest pathfinding algorithm. It works not only on grids as shown here but on any sort of graph
           structure. In a dungeon, graph locations could be rooms and graph edges the doorways between them. In a
           platformer, graph locations could be locations and graph edges the possible actions such as move left, move
           right, jump up, jump down. In general, think of the graph as states and actions that change state. </p>

        <h2 id="dijkstra"><span><a href="#dijkstra">Movement costs</a></span><a class="anchor" href="#dijkstra">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>So far we’ve made steps have the same “cost”. In some pathfinding scenarios there are different costs for
           different types of movement. For example in Civilization, moving through plains or desert might cost 1
           move-point but moving through forest or hills might cost 5 move-points. In the map at the top of the page,
           walking through water cost 10 times as much as walking through grass. Another example is diagonal movement
           on a grid that costs more than axial movement. We’d like the pathfinder to take these costs into account.
           Let’s compare the <em>number of steps</em> from the start with the <em>distance</em> from the start:</p>
        <div class="side-by-side">
           <figure id="diagram-weights-false"><canvas width="327" height="327"></canvas>
              <figcaption>Number of steps</figcaption>
           </figure>

              <figcaption>Distance</figcaption>
           </figure>
        </div>
        <p>For this we want <strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</strong> (or Uniform Cost Search). How does it differ from
           Breadth First Search? We need to track movement costs, so let’s add a new variable, <code
              class="cost_so_far">cost_so_far</code>. This stores the total movement cost from the start location, also
           called a “distance field”. We want to take the movement costs into account when deciding how to evaluate
           locations; let’s turn our queue into a priority queue. Less obviously, we may end up visiting a location
           multiple times, with different costs, so we need to alter the logic a little bit. Instead of adding a
           location to the frontier if the location has never been reached, we’ll add it if the new path to the
           location is better than the best previous path.</p>
        <pre>frontier = <em>PriorityQueue()</em>
frontier.put(start<em>, 0</em>)
came_from = dict()
cost_so_far = dict()
came_from[start] = None
cost_so_far[start] = 0

while not frontier.empty():
  current = frontier.get()

  if current == goal:
     break
  
  for next in graph.neighbors(current):
     <em>new_cost = cost_so_far[current] + graph.cost(current, next)</em>
     <em>if next not in cost_so_far or new_cost &lt; cost_so_far[next]:</em>
        cost_so_far[next] = <em>new_cost</em>
        <em>priority = new_cost</em>
        frontier.put(next<em>, priority</em>)
        came_from[next] = current</pre>
        <p>Using a priority queue instead of a regular queue <em>changes the way the frontier expands</em>. Contour
           lines are one way to see this. <strong>Start the animation</strong> to see how the frontier expands more
           slowly through the forests, finding the shortest path around the central forest instead of through it:</p>

        <p>Movement costs other than 1 allow us to explore more interesting graphs, not only grids. In the map at the
           top of the page, movement costs were based on the distance from room to room. Movement costs can also be
           used to avoid or prefer areas based on proximity to enemies or allies.</p>
        <p>Implementation notes: We want this priority queue to return the <em>lowest</em> value first. On the
           implementation page I show <code>PriorityQueue</code>  <a href="implementation.html#python-dijkstra">in
              Python</a> using <code>heapq</code> to return the lowest value first and also <a
              href="implementation.html#cpp-dijkstra">in C++</a> using <code>std::priority_queue</code> configured to
           return the lowest value first. Also, the version of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* I present on this page
           differs from what’s in algorithms textbooks. It’s much closer to what’s called Uniform Cost Search.</p>

        <p>With Breadth First Search and Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the frontier expands in all directions. This is a
           reasonable choice if you’re trying to find a path to all locations or to many locations. However, a common
           case is to find a path to only one location. Let’s make the frontier expand towards the goal more than it
           expands in other directions. First, we’ll define a <em>heuristic</em> function that tells us how close we
           are to the goal:</p>
        <pre>def heuristic(a, b):
  # Manhattan distance on a square grid
  return abs(a.x - b.x) + abs(a.y - b.y)</pre>
        <p>In Dijkstra’s Algorithm we used the actual distance from the <em>start</em> for the priority queue ordering.
           Here instead, in <strong>Greedy Best First Search</strong>, we’ll use the estimated distance to the
           <em>goal</em> for the priority queue ordering. The location closest to the goal will be explored first. The
           code uses the priority queue from Dijkstra’s Algorithm but without <code
              class="cost_so_far">cost_so_far</code>:</p>
        <pre>frontier = PriorityQueue()
frontier.put(start, 0)
came_from = dict()
came_from[start] = None

while not frontier.empty():
  current = frontier.get()

  if current == goal:
     break
  
  for next in graph.neighbors(current):
     if next not in came_from:
        <em>priority = heuristic(goal, next)</em>
        frontier.put(next, priority)
        came_from[next] = current</pre>
        <p>Let’s see how well it works:</p>

        <p>Those paths aren’t the shortest. So this algorithm runs <em>faster</em> when there aren’t a lot of
           obstacles, but the paths aren’t as <em>good</em>. Can we fix this? Yes!</p>

        <h2 id="astar"><span><a href="#astar">The A* algorithm</a></span><a class="anchor" href="#astar">#</a></h2>
        <p>Dijkstra’s Algorithm works well to find the shortest path, but it wastes time exploring in directions that
           aren’t promising. Greedy Best First Search explores in promising directions but it may not find the shortest
           path. The A* algorithm uses <em>both</em> the actual distance from the start and the estimated distance to
           the goal.</p>
        <p>The code is very similar to Dijkstra’s Algorithm:</p>
        <pre>frontier = PriorityQueue()
frontier.put(start, 0)
came_from = dict()
cost_so_far = dict()
came_from[start] = None
cost_so_far[start] = 0

while not frontier.empty():
  current = frontier.get()

  if current == goal:
     break
  
  for next in graph.neighbors(current):
     new_cost = cost_so_far[current] + graph.cost(current, next)
     if next not in cost_so_far or new_cost &lt; cost_so_far[next]:
        cost_so_far[next] = new_cost
        priority = new_cost<em> + heuristic(goal, next)</em>
        frontier.put(next, priority)
        came_from[next] = current</pre>
        <p><strong>Compare</strong> the algorithms: Dijkstra’s Algorithm calculates the distance from the start point.
           Greedy Best-First Search estimates the distance to the goal point. A* is using the sum of those two
           distances.</p>

        <p><strong>Try</strong> opening a hole in the wall in various places. You’ll find that when Greedy Best-First
           Search finds the right answer, A* finds it too, exploring the same area. When Greedy Best-First Search finds
           the wrong answer (longer path), A* finds the right answer, like Dijkstra’s Algorithm does, but still
           explores less than Dijkstra’s Algorithm does.</p>
        <p>A* is the best of both worlds. As long as the heuristic does not overestimate distances, A* finds an optimal
           path, like Dijkstra’s Algorithm does. A* uses the heuristic to reorder the nodes so that it’s <em>more
              likely</em> that the goal node will be encountered sooner.</p>
        <p>And … that’s it! That’s the A* algorithm.</p>

        <p>Which algorithm should you use for finding paths on a map?</p>
        <ul>
           <li>If you want to find paths from or to <em>all</em> all locations, use Breadth First Search or Dijkstra’s
              Algorithm. Use Breadth First Search if movement costs are all the same; use Dijkstra’s Algorithm if
              movement costs vary.</li>
           <li>If you want to find paths to <em>one</em> location, or the closest of several goals, use Greedy Best
              First Search or A*. Prefer A* in most cases. When you’re tempted to use Greedy Best First Search,
              consider using A* with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic">“inadmissible”
                 heuristic</a><sup class="print-endnote">[6]</sup>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What about optimal paths? Breadth First Search and Dijkstra’s Algorithm are guaranteed to find the shortest
           path given the input graph. Greedy Best First Search is not. A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path if
           the heuristic is never larger than the true distance. As the heuristic becomes smaller, A* turns into
           Dijkstra’s Algorithm. As the heuristic becomes larger, A* turns into Greedy Best First Search.</p>
        <p>What about performance? The best thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary locations in your graph. Reducing the size of the graph helps all the graph
           search algorithms. After that, use the simplest algorithm you can; simpler queues run faster. Greedy Best
           First Search typically runs faster than Dijkstra’s Algorithm but doesn’t produce optimal paths. A* is a good
           choice for most pathfinding needs.</p>
        <p>What about non-maps? I show maps here because I think it’s easier to understand how the algorithms work by
           using a map. However, these graph search algorithms can be used on any sort of graph, not only maps, and
           I’ve tried to present the algorithm code in a way that’s independent of 2d grids. Movement costs on the maps
           become arbitrary weights on graph edges. The heuristic encodes information about the graph, so you have to
           design a heuristic for each type of graph. For planar maps, distances are a good choice, so that’s what I’ve
           used here.</p>
